## Robot Reporter
Robot Reporter is a tool for Robot Framework test reporting. This can be paired with[robotframework-docker-action](https://github.com/joonvena/robotframework-docker-action). When it's run it parses the output.xml file from test results and then sends report as comment to that specific commmit that triggered the test run.
